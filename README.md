An arcade arena FPS game built off a [Unity port of a Quake III style character controller](https://github.com/WiggleWizard/quake3-movement-unity3d) and [Sebastian Lagues boid simulation](https://github.com/SebLague/Boids). Both of which have been refactored heavily to match the style guide and archiecture of existing game systems.
